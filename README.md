# [nofi - Nim OpenFabrics Interface](https://github.com/ct-clmsn/nofi)

Nofi wraps the existing [rofi](https://github.com/pnnl/rofi) interface implemented by Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory (PNNL). Nofi provides the Nim programming language support
for RDMA distributed communication (put and get), fundamental operations
for [PGAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitioned_global_address_space) applications.

This library extends rofi by providing a [sequence type](https://nim-lang.org/docs/system.html#seq) that wraps memory
registered with the underlying rofi RDMA communicaton library. The sequence type
only supports values that are of [SomeNumber](https://nim-lang.org/docs/system.html#SomeNumber) types. The sequence
type provides element-access, slice, iterator, and partitioning support.

Additional functionality is provided to handle asynchronous `put` and `get` operations using Nim's [defer statements](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#exception-handling-defer-statement), combining [templates](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#templates) with [try statements](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#exception-handling-try-expression), and [futures](https://nim-lang.org/docs/asyncfutures.html).

**Nim applications using nofi require static compilation and linking!**

### Install

Download and install [rofi](https://github.com/pnnl/rofi)
```
./configure --prefix=<PATH_TO_INSTALL_DIR>
make && make install
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<PATH_TO_INSTALL_DIR>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Modify `makefile` to point `LIBDIR` and `INCDIR` to the
path set in `<PATH_TO_INSTALL_DIR>`. Use the makefile to
see if your setup compiles.
```
make
```

Use the nimble tool to install nofi
```
nimble install nofi
```

Generate documentation from source
```
nimble doc nofi
```

### Important Developer Notes

Nofi demonstrates the versitility of the [rofi library](https://github.com/pnnl/rofi) and
it's value as a lightweight technology for extending RDMA
support via libfabric to languages that have a FFI (foreign
function interface) compatible with C.

Users need to review the [rofi documentation](https://github.com/pnnl/rofi/blob/master/README.md) prior
to using this library in order to understand rofi's feature
set and potential limitations.

This library requires static compilation of an end user's
Nim program. Please review the `makefile` to learn how to
enable static compilation and linking with the Nim compiler.

Users must initialize and terminate all programs using
`nofi_init` and `nofi_finit`. Not taking this step will
result in undefined behavior.

Users are strongly encouraged to utilize Nim blocks and
scoping rules to managing memory that has been registered
with nofi. Users can review 'tests/test_sharray.nim' for
an example of memory management using Nim blocks and scopes.
